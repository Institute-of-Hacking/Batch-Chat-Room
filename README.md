# Batch-Chat-Room
## Batch Chat Room 2.0
### How To Install It
The batch chat room is a program sourced from alot of other batch programs like login cmd and a simple batch chat. I made them and made them even better
 so how do you install this...?
## Download the zip
Download the zip and extract it into a folder (Copy the dir of the folder like `Documents\Chat\`)
## Open `Chat run.bat` with notepad and or notepad++
Set `set dirworking=%userprofile%\Documents\Testingarea` to your copied dir with the `%userprofile%` instead of the `C:\Users\{user}`
 then set `set superadmin=Kade` to what your user name is gonna be like `set superadmin=Jim` you can add other superadmins too by renaming
 None with there names.
 Then replace `set saveadmin=%userprofile%\Documents\Testingarea\AdminSaves` with your copied dir like this `set saveadmin=%userprofile%\Documents\Chat\AdminSaves`
 Then your all done. Run `Chat room.bat` Then make a account that you named for your superadmin. And then do !c for the commands. Also if you want debug mode
 just change `set debug=Off` to `set debug=On` and `set chatpublic=On` to `set chatpublic=Off`
## Thanks for using Kades Chat System!
